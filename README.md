<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Indulence is a semester project completed during the second half of the semester. This project is for CSCI-UA 071 Collaborating Remotely Fall 2022.

Indulgence uses Plaid API to view a user's transaction history from the past 48 months, and determines what circle of hell they would theoretically be placed into.

The following are all possible sins:
* Limbo - people who lived ethically and morally but were never baptized
* Lust - those who committed adultery
* Gluttony - indulging in food or drink excessively; excessive purchases
* Greed - people who hoarded or squandered their money; strove to hold as much material wealth as possible
* Wrath - those who became easily or violently angered; those who were sullen, or moody and grumpy, in life
+ Heresy - rejection of religious and/or political “norms"; holding beliefs contrary to those taught by orthodox theologies such as Christianity
* Violence - violence against others through murder, beatings, or destruction of property; violence against themselves
* Fraud - those who consciously and willingly commit fraud; Panderers and seducers, flatterers; sorcerers and false prophets, liars, thieves
* Treachery - betrayers of special relationships

Indulgences' sin-sort system is inspired by Dante's Inferno.
